## by (Abimbola Akinjobi)


## Dataset

> The prosper Loan dataset provided by Udacity wasused for this project. 
The dataset had details about loans including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income e.t.c. The prosper loan dataset has 113,937 rows of data and 81 columns. Some modifications were made to the dataset using the variabale definition as a guide to identify data points important to my analysis/exploration. 

The listing category was modified to reflect the borrower selected: 0 - Not Available, 1 - Debt Consolidation, 2 - Home Improvement, 3 - Business, 4 - Personal Loan, 5 - Student Use, 6 - Auto, 7- Other, 8 - Baby&Adoption, 9 - Boat, 10 - Cosmetic Procedure, 11 - Engagement Ring, 12 - Green Loans, 13 - Household Expenses, 14 - Large Purchases, 15 - Medical/Dental, 16 - Motorcycle, 17 - RV, 18 - Taxes, 19 - Vacation, 20 - Wedding Loans.


I also modified the dataset by selecting columns that i was interested in to ease my analysis process.


My sole interest was on the borrower's rate and then the loan status and employment status. These three variables were compared against other metrics. I also looked at other variable like Term and whether borrowers were home owners or not.
